            <h2>Korea</h2>
            <div>The purpose of creating this webpage is for friends who come to Korea. Sometimes, some of my foreign friends come to Korea to visit, but they don't know where to go, so I'm going to select the best places and introduce them to beautiful places in Korea. From now on, I would like to introduce a few places!</div>
