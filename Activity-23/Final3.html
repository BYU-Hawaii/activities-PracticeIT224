            <h1>Roles</h1>
            <p>At first, basketball was very simple, but over time it evolved into a much more complex and dynamic game. Dribbling, which didn’t even exist at the start, became one of the sport’s fundamental skills. In the 1950s, the 24-second shot clock was introduced to speed up the pace of the game and prevent teams from holding onto the ball too long. Then, in the 1960s and 1970s, the three-point line was added. This gave teams a new strategy, rewarding players who could hit long-distance shots.
                The roles of players became more specialized as well. Positions like center, forward, and guard were established, and each had a unique skill set. Coaches developed new strategies, such as the pick-and-roll, fast breaks, and zone defenses, all of which made the game more exciting and strategic. Basketball also became more inclusive, with the creation of women’s leagues and international competitions that showcased talent from around the world.
