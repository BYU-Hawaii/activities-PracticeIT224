            <h1>Welcome to Basketball history!</h1>
            <p>Basketball, one of the most popular sports in the world today, had a very humble beginning. In 1891, Dr. James Naismith, a Canadian physical education teacher, created the game while working at the YMCA Training School in Springfield, Massachusetts. He wanted a way to keep his students active indoors during the cold winters, so he came up with a new game. He nailed two peach baskets to a balcony and used a soccer ball to play. The rules were simple—just 13 in total—and players weren’t allowed to dribble. They could only pass and shoot. The very first game had nine players on each team, and it was a simple start.</p>
