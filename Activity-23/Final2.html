            <p>Basketball caught on quickly. By the early 1900s, schools, colleges, and community groups across the United States began playing it. As the gameâ€™s popularity grew, the equipment improved. By 1906, peach baskets were replaced with metal hoops, and backboards were added to keep fans from interfering with the ball. The soccer ball was replaced with a ball made specifically for basketball, making the game smoother and more enjoyable.
                The mid-20th century saw the emergence of organized leagues, which helped shape basketball into what we know today. In 1949, the BAA (Basketball Association of America) and the NBL (National Basketball League) merged to form the NBA (National Basketball Association), turning basketball into a professional sport. College basketball grew as well, with the NCAA Tournament becoming a key cultural event. And while it started in the United States, basketball quickly spread around the globe and became an Olympic sport in 1936.
