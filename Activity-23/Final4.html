            <h1>Current Roles</h1>
            <p>Todayâ€™s basketball games are played on a rectangular court with hoops at each end, standing 10 feet above the ground. The court is divided by a midcourt line, and a three-point arc surrounds each basket. Most games consist of four quarters, each lasting 10 to 12 minutes depending on the league. For example, the NBA plays four 12-minute quarters, while college basketball often uses two 20-minute halves.
                Each team has five players on the court, and substitutions can be made during stoppages. Scoring is straightforward: two points for shots inside the three-point line, three points for shots beyond it, and one point for free throws. If a player commits violations like traveling (taking too many steps without dribbling) or double dribbling (starting to dribble again after stopping), the other team gets the ball.
                Fouls are carefully regulated. Personal fouls, technical fouls, and flagrant fouls all carry different penalties. Teams are penalized after accumulating a certain number of fouls in a period, often resulting in free throws for their opponents. To ensure accuracy, referees now use instant replay, which helps maintain a fair and well-officiated game.
